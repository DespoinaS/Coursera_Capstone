A positive result of this fact is that people can have prior knowledge of the world outside their homes, before even going out. We can search for restaurant reviews and look into the menu before going there. We have weather forcasts for the days coming. We can online check in to our flights and choose our seat or we can book a ticket for a museum or a movie. All these privileges can prevent us from having a bad experience, wait to long queues and they save us a lot of time. Of course, all of the above could not be done without the data that are provided.\n\nIn this project, we are going to use a dataset regarding car accidents in Seattle city. Our purpose is to built a machine learning project, which can predict the severity of an accident given same independent variables, suc as weather conditions, road traffic and visibility conditions. This will help in reducing the frequency of car collisions in the specific community.\n\n# Data Understanding\n\nOur dataset in hand cossists of 37 independent variables (columns) and 194,673 observations (rows).  The sourse of our data is the Seattle Police Department and Accident Traffic Records Department and includes information from 2004 until now. \"SEVERITYCODE\" is going to be our dependent (target) variable, in other words the one to be predicted. Our target variable consists of numbers from 0 to 4 that correspond to different levels of severity caused by an accident and are coded as follows:\n\n- 0: Little to no Probability - (Clear Conditions)\n\n- 1: Very Low Probability \u2014 Chance or Property Damage\n\n- 2: Low Probability \u2014 Chance of Injury\n\n- 3: Mild Probability \u2014 Chance of Serious Injury\n\n- 4: High Probability \u2014 Chance of Fatality\n\nThe shape and form of our data is not a"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
